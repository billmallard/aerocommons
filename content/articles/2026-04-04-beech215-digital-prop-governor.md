## Open-Source Replacement for the Airborne Electronics 350A

**License:** [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)  
**Platform:** Arduino  
**Repository:** [github.com/billmallard/Beech215PropController](https://github.com/billmallard/Beech215PropController)

A modern, proportional-control replacement for the Airborne Electronics 350A solid-state propeller governor — for Beechcraft Bonanza models with the Beech 215-210 electric prop.

---

## The Problem This Solves

The original Airborne Electronics 350A (covered under STC SA2700WE) uses a **bang-bang control architecture** — the prop motor runs at full voltage until the RPM crosses the target, then reverses. This causes constant RPM hunting, which is made worse by:

- **Freshly overhauled prop motors** with more torque than the 50-year-old electronics expected
- **Aging capacitors and resistors** in the original controller that shrink the deadband
- **The original panel rheostat** giving no indication of what RPM is actually set
- **Rough magneto signal** from high-time mags degrading the RPM sensing

This project replaces only the electronics inside the governor box. The 7-pin Cannon connector, airframe wiring, prop motor, limit switches, and relays are all unchanged. **From the aircraft's perspective, the interface is identical to the original.**

---

## What It Does Differently

| Feature | Original 350A | Digital Governor |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **Control type** | Bang-bang (full voltage on/off) | Proportional — slows motor near setpoint |
| **Deadband** | Fixed by aging analog components | Software-configurable (default ±25 RPM) |
| **RPM display** | None — knob position only | OLED shows set RPM and actual RPM |
| **Presets** | None | 5 named presets (Max, Cruise Climb, Cruise, Economy, Emergency) |
| **Setpoint transition** | Instant jump (causes full-duty relay surge) | Soft ramp 100 RPM/sec — smooth, no lurch |
| **Fail-safe** | RPM signal loss → no action | Loss of mag signal → relays de-energize, alarm displayed |
| **Watchdog** | None | Hardware watchdog resets MCU in 250ms if firmware stalls |
| **Motor runaway protection** | Limit switches only | 8-second relay timeout regardless of limit switch state |

## Who This Is For

Any Beechcraft Bonanza (straight 35 through G35, A35–G35) equipped with:

- The **Beech 215-210 electric prop**
- An existing **Airborne Electronics 350A** installation (STC SA2700WE)

**If you have the stock mechanical governor, this is not applicable.**

---

## Regulatory Note

This project is designed for **owner-produced parts under 14 CFR Part 21.303**. The STC SA2700WE defines the system by its external interface — the 7-pin connector, wire assignments, and functional behavior — all of which are preserved exactly. The electronics inside the governor housing are replaced.

**This is a major alteration and requires FAA Form 337 approval signed by an IA.** See [docs/REGULATORY.md](https://github.com/billmallard/Beech215PropController/blob/main/docs/REGULATORY.md) for a detailed discussion and suggested 337 language.

---

## Hardware Overview

The system consists of two units:

### Governor Box (replaces the 350A housing, mounts in the same location)

- Arduino Nano (ATmega328P)
- 6N137 optocoupler (galvanic isolation of magneto P-lead)
- ULN2003A Darlington array (relay driver)
- LM2596S-5V DC-DC switching regulator
- Supporting passives

### Panel Unit (replaces the knob/rheostat assembly)

- SSD1306 1.3" OLED display (128×64, I2C)
- 5-position rotary switch (one detent per preset — Lorlin CK1024 or Grayhill 56-series)
- Original prop control knob reuses directly on the switch shaft

The PCB is a **100mm × 80mm 2-layer FR4 board**, designed for JLCPCB fabrication at approximately **$2 for 5 boards**. The panel cable is 10 conductors (simplified from earlier designs).

## Quick Start

1. **Order the PCB** — Upload `hardware/350A_governor_JLCPCB.zip` to [jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com/). Default settings (2-layer, FR4, 1.6mm, HASL, green) are fine.

2. **Order components** — See [hardware/BOM.md](https://github.com/billmallard/Beech215PropController/blob/main/hardware/BOM.md). Total ~$55–95 for a complete build.

3. **Assemble** — Follow [docs/ASSEMBLY.md](https://github.com/billmallard/Beech215PropController/blob/main/docs/ASSEMBLY.md). All through-hole components; no SMD soldering.

4. **Flash firmware** — Open `firmware/governor_350A/governor_350A.ino` in Arduino IDE. Set `PULSES_PER_REV` for your engine. Flash to the Nano before installing.

5. **Bench test** — Build the test harness described in [docs/BENCH_TEST.md](https://github.com/billmallard/Beech215PropController/blob/main/docs/BENCH_TEST.md) and verify operation before touching the aircraft.

6. **Install** — Follow [docs/ASSEMBLY.md](https://github.com/billmallard/Beech215PropController/blob/main/docs/ASSEMBLY.md) aircraft installation section. Have your IA present.

## Engine Compatibility

Set `PULSES_PER_REV` in the firmware before flashing:

| Engine | Cylinders | `PULSES_PER_REV` |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| Continental IO-470 | 6 | 3 |
| Continental IO-520 | 6 | 3 |
| Continental E-185/E-225 | 6 | 3 |
| Lycoming O-435 | 6 | 3 |

**All early Bonanzas use Continental 6-cylinder engines. `PULSES_PER_REV = 3` is correct for all of them.**

- Firmware improvements (better control algorithms, additional safety checks)
- Documentation corrections
- Hardware revisions (alternative component footprints, panel unit PCB)
- Flight test data and tuning recommendations

Please open an issue before starting significant work so efforts aren't duplicated.
